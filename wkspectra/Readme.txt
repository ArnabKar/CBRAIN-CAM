For Stephan: Some scripts for intercomparing 15S-15N PRECT Wheeler-Kiladis spectra, by pritch.

All you need are the two source files wkspectra.csh, and its dependent wkspectra.ncl

With these in a fresh directory, if all links to the raw model directory are visible,
just running the csh script should collect what it needs from your 6-hourly history tape
in order to self-generate a set of W-K figures for each model.

Then my two favorite diagnostics are concatenated across experiments for intercomparison in figs/compare/*
