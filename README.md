`config` contains config files specifying the input and output variables.

`data_processing` contains pre-processing scripts that convert the raw climate model data to convenient input data for the neural net.

`diagnostics` contains scripts to analyze the neural net predictions compared to the target data.

`keras_network` contains the Keras neural network.

`logs` contains Tensorboard logs. (They are saved so that I can access them remotely without having to tunnel...)

`notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks.
